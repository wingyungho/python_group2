TASK
Stock returns. Calculate the daily returns for all stocks in the data. Discuss the returns over
the year: what companies experienced the maximum and minimum daily returns - can you
find the reasons for these? Which companies performed overall best and worst over the year?
Which companies exhibited most and least volatility, as measured by the standard deviation
of their returns over the year?
